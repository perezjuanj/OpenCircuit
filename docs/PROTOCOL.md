# RingConn Gen 2 — BLE Protocol (living spec)

This is the primary deliverable of Phase 1. Everything here is an **observation**,
not vendor documentation. Mark each fact with a confidence level and the capture it
came from. Treat unconfirmed entries as hypotheses to disprove.

Confidence legend: 🟢 confirmed (reproduced) · 🟡 probable · 🔴 guess / unverified

**Reference capture:** Android btsnoop, FW **FR02.018**, ring `RingConn Gen2-03AD`
(MAC `F8:79:99:F7:03:AD`), 2026-06-13 21:51. 326 ATT events: identity reads, a live
measurement (`0x95` poll loop), and a bulk history/PPG download. Pin observations
below to this FW until re-confirmed on another version.

---

## 0. Encryption gate — ANSWERED 🟢

**The BLE application layer is NOT encrypted.** ATT payloads in the capture are
plaintext: readable identity strings, monotonic counters, and a checksum that
validates (§3). No app-layer key exchange or challenge/response precedes data
access. Offline decoding is viable → the iOS app is unblocked.
(Link-layer LE encryption, if any, is transparent to CoreBluetooth — irrelevant.)

## 1. Connection & GATT layout

> ⚠️ Reported as not fully GATT-compatible. The capture confirms the app drives the
> ring almost entirely through two value handles (`0x0802` write, `0x0804` notify)
> rather than discrete per-metric characteristics.

### Identity (Device Information Service `0x180a`)
| Item | Value | Conf. | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advertised name (GAP `0x2a00`, val handle `0x0003`) | `RingConn Gen2-03AD` (suffix = last 2 MAC bytes) | 🟢 | capture + scan |
| Manufacturer (`0x2a29`, val `0x0032`) | `JZ_Tech` | 🟢 | capture + scan |
| Serial (`0x2a25`, val `0x0034`) | `RCA1F252311002B09` | 🟢 | capture + scan |
| Firmware (`0x2a26`, val `0x0036`) | `FR02.018` | 🟢 | capture + scan |
| System ID / MAC (`0x2a23`, val `0x0038`) | `F8:79:99:F7:03:AD` | 🟢 | capture + scan |
| Hardware rev (`0x2a27`, val `0x003a`) | `00010001` | 🟢 | capture + scan |

### Primary data service `8327ad99-2d87-4a22-a8ce-6dd7971c0437` (handle `0x0800`) 🟢
The ring is driven entirely through this notify/command pair (not per-metric chars).
iOS addresses by UUID; the value handle = characteristic declaration handle + 1.

| Role | Characteristic UUID | Decl. | **Value** | Props | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Write / commands** | `8327ad98-2d87-4a22-a8ce-6dd7971c0437` | `0x0801` | `0x0802` | write | 🟢 |
| **Notify (all responses + data)** | `8327ad97-2d87-4a22-a8ce-6dd7971c0437` | `0x0803` | `0x0804` | notify | 🟢 |
| Notify CCCD (enable w/ `01 00`) | `0x2902` | — | `0x0805` | — | 🟢 |

### Secondary service `1d14d6ee-fd63-4fa1-bfa4-8f47b42119f0` (handle `0x0900`) 🔴
Two **write** characteristics; role unobserved in the capture (likely OTA/firmware
or bulk transfer). Not used by the main protocol. Decode if needed later.

| Characteristic UUID | Handle | Props |
|---|---|---|
| `f7bf3564-fb6d-4e53-88a4-5e37e0326063` | `0x0901` | write |
| `984227f3-34fc-4045-a5d0-2c581f81a153` | `0x0903` | write, write-without-response |

> Corrections now confirmed by `scan`: (1) GB #4506's char UUIDs were right
> (🟡→🟢). (2) GB #4506 mislabeled `f7bf3564`/`984227f3` as *services* — they are
> *characteristics* inside service `1d14d6ee`; the real data service is `8327ad99`.
> (3) value handle = decl + 1, which ties the scan to the capture's `0x0802`/`0x0804`.

## 2. Authentication / handshake

**No app-layer handshake observed.** After enabling notifications (`0x0805 ← 01 00`)
the app immediately issues data commands and the ring responds — no token, no
challenge, no key derived from MAC/serial. History sync uses the same channel as
live data with no extra auth. (Re-verify on a *fresh pair* capture to be certain a
one-time bonding step isn't being skipped on an already-bonded phone.)

## 3. Framing 🟢 (verified live on the Mac)

**Commands and responses use DIFFERENT trailers — this corrects an earlier error.**

**Responses (RX, ring → host):** `[respid][payload…][xor]`
- **respid = command id XOR 0x80**: `01→81 · 02→82 · 06→86 · 07→87 · 95→15 · c7→47 · cc→4c · d0→50` (10 cmds reproduced).
- **xor trailer** = XOR of all preceding bytes. Validates on 86/88 RX frames. (The two `0x50` status frames lack it — see §5.)

**Commands (TX, host → ring):** `[cmd][sub][payload…][00]` — **NOT checksummed.**
- Sent **verbatim**; the last byte is a literal `0x00`, not an XOR. ⚠️ The GB #4506
  keepalive `95 00 95` is **wrong**; the real command is `95 00 00`. Building command
  frames by appending an XOR trailer produces invalid bytes the ring ignores.
- The ring ATT-acks any write but only *acts* on commands whose contents are valid.

Bulk frames (`0x47`/`0x4c`) pack fixed-size records prefixed `0c 09 <counter>`
(counter += ~0x0384/record). The page is continued by ACKing: a `0x47` page →
write `c7 00 00`; a `0x4c` page → write `cc 00 00`; the last page carries
remaining-count byte `0x00`.

## 4. Commands (request → response) 🟢

| Command | Write (hex) | Resp | Role | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status read | `01 00 00` | `81 00 ..` | works unauthenticated; only cmd that replies cold | 🟢 |
| Status read 2 | `01 01 31 82 67 00` | `81 01 ..` (38B) | record/config table | 🟢 |
| **Sync open** | `02 00 <cursor:4> 00 01 00` | `82 ..` | opens data session; **cursor, not wall-clock** | 🟢 |
| Fetch / stream | `07 00 00` | `87`/`15`/`47`/`4c` | pulls next data per current mode | 🟢 |
| Live-HR mode | `06 01 00` | `86 00 86` | switch session to live HR | 🟢 |
| Poll | `95 00 00` | `15 ..` | one live sample per poll | 🟢 |
| Page ACK | `c7 00 00` / `cc 00 00` | `47`/`4c` | continue bulk transfer | 🟢 |
| Status query | `d0 00 00` | `10`/`50` | session/record status | 🟡 |

**The `02` arg is a sync CURSOR, not a timestamp** (🟢, this was the key unlock).
Real-time values are *rejected* (no `82`); only a cursor **≥ the ring's last-synced
position** is accepted. `02 00 FF FF FF FF 00 01 00` (max) always works and means
"sync everything". The capture's `0c 22 98 c3` was the app's then-current cursor;
replaying it now fails because the ring has since advanced past it.

**Verified live-HR sequence (from the Mac, `desktop/livehr.py`):**
```
01 00 00                  -> 81 ..        (wake/status)
01 01 31 82 67 00         -> 81 01 ..     (config table)
02 00 FF FF FF FF 00 01 00 -> 82 ..       (open sync, cursor=all)
07 00 00 + c7/cc acks     -> 87,47,4c ..  (drain any history backlog)
06 01 00                  -> 86 00 86     (enter live-HR mode)
07 00 00                  -> 15 ..        (first live sample)
95 00 00  (repeat)        -> 15 00 <hr> 0a b0 <xor>   (one HR sample per poll)
```
Caveats (🟡): live `15` frames require the ring **worn with good skin contact** and
a few seconds of PPG warm-up; and the ring sleeps/stops advertising seconds after
disconnect (wake via charger contact or motion). Metric-specific sync commands
(sleep/HRV/SpO2/steps/temp) not yet isolated.

> **Open blocker for live-HR-on-demand (🟡).** `02` (session-open) only replies
> `82` when the ring has **pending data to sync**. `02 00 FFFFFFFF…` returned `82`
> + history while a backlog existed, but once the backlog is drained it goes silent,
> so the session never opens and `06`/live never engages. In the reference capture,
> live HR was entered *while the history session was still open*. To crack
> live-HR-only cleanly we need a **fresh Android capture of ONLY a manual HR
> measurement** (no history sync) — that isolates the minimal live-HR entry without
> the history-session entanglement. Until then, live HR is confirmed by the capture
> (byte[2] of `0x15`) but not yet reproduced on demand from the Mac.

## 5. Decoded metric formats

### Heart rate (live) 🟡
`0x95` poll → `0x15` frames. During the reading the candidate HR byte climbs
`0x52 0x54 0x58 0x5a 0x5b` (82→91) — consistent with a settling pulse measurement.
Example: `15 00 5b 0a b0 f4` (byte[2] = HR, `f4` = XOR trailer). **Confirm with a
two-reading diff** (capture two HR measurements ~10 bpm apart, diff the `0x15`
frames to lock the offset). Longer `15 01 …` frames carry additional fields
(SpO2/perfusion?), ending `… 00 60 …` (0x60 = 96).

### Bulk PPG / waveform (history) 🟡
`0x47`/`0x4c` frames, `0c 09 <ctr>`-delimited records. `0x47` records hold a
smoothly-varying ~3-byte field (raw PPG, drifts monotonically); `0x4c` records hold
a repeating `01 01 01 01 01` pattern (likely accelerometer/activity or stage marks).

### Status frames 🟡
`0x10`/`0x50` (`d0 00 00 →`), e.g. `10 4e 02 00 00 00 01 09 01 05 … 10 31 00 ff …` —
fixed-shape session/record descriptor (counts, cursor). No XOR trailer on the two
`0x50` variants; treat as a distinct frame class.

### (others)
Document each as decoded: byte offsets, scale/units, timestamp encoding
(epoch? minutes-since? local vs UTC?), and how multi-record pages are delimited.

## How to extend this file

1. Capture with the official app doing one thing (e.g. only a SpO2 measurement).
2. Isolate the writes/notifications in that window (`openringconn decode-log`).
3. Form a hypothesis about the command + response format; note it 🔴.
4. Replay the write with `openringconn replay` and confirm the response → 🟡.
5. Reproduce across sessions / values until stable → 🟢.
